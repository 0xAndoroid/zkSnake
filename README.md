# Bonsai Foundry Template

> **Note: This software is not production ready. Do not use in production.**

Starter template for writing an application using [Bonsai].

This repository implements an application on Ethereum utilizing Bonsai as a [coprocessor] to the smart contract application.
It provides a starting point for building powerful new applications on Ethereum that offload computationally intensive, or difficult to implement, tasks to be proven by the [RISC Zero] [zkVM], with verifiable results sent to your Ethereum contract.

*For a 60 second overview of how this template and off-chain computation with Bonsai work, [check out the video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDS8X8H9mIk).*

## Overview

The picture below shows a simplified overview of how users can integrate Bonsai into their Ethereum smart contracts:

![Bonsai Relay Diagram](images/BonsaiRelay.png)

1. Users can delegate their smart contract's logic to Bonsai. The [Bonsai Relay Contract](lib/risc0/bonsai/ethereum/contracts/relay/BonsaiRelay.sol) provides a `Request Callback` interface. This interface, accessible both *off-chain* (through HTTP REST API) and *on-chain*, emits an event detected by the `Ethereum Bonsai Relayer`.
2. The `Ethereum Bonsai Relayer` sends the proof request to Bonsai.
3. Bonsai generates a Snark proof and its result, encapsulated in a journal.
4. The `Ethereum Bonsai Relayer` submits this proof and journal on-chain to the `Bonsai Relay Contract` for validation.
5. If validated, the journal is dispatched to the user's smart contract via the specified callback.

## Dependencies
First, [install Rust] and [Foundry], and then restart your terminal. Next, you will need to install the `cargo risczero` tool.
We'll use `cargo binstall` to get `cargo-risczero` installed. See [cargo-binstall] for more details.

```bash
cargo install cargo-binstall
cargo binstall cargo-risczero
```

Next we'll need to install the `risc0` toolchain with:

```
cargo risczero install
```

## Quick Start
First, install the RISC Zero toolchain using the instructions above.

Now, you can initialize a new Bonsai project at a location of your choosing:

```bash
forge init -t risc0/bonsai-foundry-template ./my-project
```
Congratulations! You've just built your first Bonsai project.
Your new project consists of:
- a [`zkVM program`] (written in Rust), which specifies a computation that will be proven
- a [`contract`] (written in Solidity), which receives the response

Requesting a proof can be done via both *off-chain* or *on-chain* requests.

[install Rust]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html
[Foundry]: https://getfoundry.sh/
[cargo-binstall]: https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall#cargo-binaryinstall
[`zkVM program`]: https://github.com/risc0/bonsai-foundry-template/tree/main/methods/guest/src/bin
[`contract`]: https://github.com/risc0/bonsai-foundry-template/tree/main/contracts

### Test Your Project
- Use `cargo build` to test compilation of your zkVM program.
- Use `cargo test` to run the tests in your zkVM program.
- Use `forge test` to test your Solidity contracts and their interaction with your zkVM program.

### Configuring Bonsai
***Note:*** *The Bonsai proving service is still in early Alpha. To request an API key [complete the form here](https://bonsai.xyz/apply).*

With the Bonsai proving service, you can produce a [Groth16 SNARK proof] that is verifiable on-chain.
You can get started by setting the following environment variables with your API key and associated URL.

```bash
export BONSAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY" # see form linked above
export BONSAI_API_URL="BONSAI_URL" # provided with your api key
```

Now if you run `forge test` with `RISC0_DEV_MODE=false`, the test will run as before, but will additionally use the fully verifying `BonsaiRelay` contract instead of `BonsaiTestRelay` and will request a SNARK receipt from Bonsai.

```bash
RISC0_DEV_MODE=false forge test
```

## Next Steps
To build your application, you'll need to make changes in two folders:
- write the code you want proven in the [methods] folder
- write the on-chain part of your project in the [contracts] folder

Then, you're ready to [deploy your project]. <br/>
